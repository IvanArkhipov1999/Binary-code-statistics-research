# Binary-code-statistics-research
This repository contains code for research of binary code statistics. Text with interim results you can find in my report in [the repository of magisters' reports of students of Department of System Programming of SPBU](https://github.com/spbu-se/mag_practices_2021-2023).

Dataset for research is loaded in [a separate repository](https://github.com/IvanArkhipov1999/Binaries-dataset).

[*text_segment.py*](https://github.com/IvanArkhipov1999/Binary-code-statistics-research/blob/main/text_segment.py) contains function for extracting code segment from binary file

[*pass_and_compile.py*](https://github.com/IvanArkhipov1999/Binary-code-statistics-research/blob/main/pass_and_compile.py) contains function for passing through source folder and compiling files
